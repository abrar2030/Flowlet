## Test Strategy for Flowlet

This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the Flowlet platform, covering unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance testing.

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will focus on individual functions, methods, and classes within each microservice to ensure their isolated correctness. Key areas to cover:

- **Wallet Service**: 
  - Wallet creation, update, and deletion.
  - Balance management (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
  - Transaction history logging.
  - State transitions (e.g., active, suspended, closed).
- **Payment Processing**: 
  - Validation of payment requests.
  - Routing logic for different payment methods.
  - Transaction status updates.
  - Fee calculation.
- **Card Issuance and Management**: 
  - Card issuance (virtual/physical).
  - Card activation/deactivation.
  - Spending limit enforcement.
  - Card control functionalities (e.g., freezing, merchant categories).
- **KYC/AML Compliance**: 
  - Identity verification workflows.
  - Risk assessment logic.
  - Document processing and validation.
  - Ongoing monitoring triggers.
- **Ledger and Accounting**: 
  - Double-entry accounting principles enforcement.
  - Journal entry generation.
  - Real-time balance calculations.
  - Reconciliation logic.
- **API Gateway**: 
  - Authentication and authorization logic.
  - Rate limiting.
  - Request routing.
  - Response caching.
- **AI-Enhanced Capabilities (Fraud Detection)**: 
  - Fraud detection model inference.
  - Alert generation.
  - Anomaly detection.

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify the interactions between different services and components, ensuring data consistency and correct flow across the system. Key scenarios:

- **Payment Flow**: 
  - User initiates payment -> Wallet balance updated -> Ledger entry created -> Payment processor interaction.
  - Handling of successful and failed payments.
- **Card Transaction Flow**: 
  - Card swipe/online transaction -> Wallet balance updated -> Ledger entry created.
  - Enforcement of card controls during transactions.
- **Onboarding Flow**: 
  - User signup -> Wallet creation -> KYC/AML verification process.
  - Handling of different verification outcomes.
- **API Gateway to Service Communication**: 
  - Successful routing of requests from API Gateway to respective microservices.
  - Error handling for service unavailability.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests will simulate complete user journeys, from the frontend UI to the backend services, ensuring the entire system functions as expected from a user's perspective. Building upon `test_user_flow.py`:

- **Full User Registration and Login**: 
  - Registration with valid/invalid data.
  - Login with correct/incorrect credentials.
- **Wallet Operations via UI**: 
  - Deposit/Withdrawal through UI.
  - Viewing transaction history.
- **Card Management via UI**: 
  - Requesting a new card.
  - Freezing/unfreezing a card.
- **Payment Initiation via UI**: 
  - Making a payment to another user/merchant.
  - Viewing payment status.

### 4. Performance Tests

Performance tests will assess the system's scalability, responsiveness, and stability under various load conditions using Locust. Expanding on `locustfile.py`:

- **Concurrent User Simulations**: 
  - Simulating a large number of concurrent users performing various operations (e.g., login, wallet transactions, API calls).
- **Load Spikes**: 
  - Testing system behavior under sudden increases in load.
- **Long Duration Tests**: 
  - Monitoring system stability and resource utilization over extended periods.

### 5. Test Directory Structure

The existing `tests` directory structure will be maintained and expanded:

```
/tests
├── e2e
│   └── test_user_flow.py
├── integration
│   └── test_payment_flow.py
├── performance
│   └── locustfile.py
└── unit
    ├── test_wallet.py
    ├── test_payment_processor.py
    ├── test_card_service.py
    ├── test_kyc_aml.py
    ├── test_ledger.py
    ├── test_api_gateway.py
    └── test_fraud_detection.py
```

### 6. Test Implementation Guidelines

- Use Python's `unittest` or `pytest` framework for unit and integration tests.
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., external APIs, databases) for unit tests to ensure isolation.
- Use realistic test data for integration and E2E tests.
- Ensure tests are atomic, independent, repeatable, self-validating, and timely.
- Maintain clear and concise test names that describe the functionality being tested.
