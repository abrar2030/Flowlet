# Flowlet - Test Suite

This directory contains the comprehensive test suite for the Flowlet embedded finance platform. The tests are organized into various categories to ensure the reliability, functionality, and performance of the system across different layers of its architecture. This README provides an overview of the testing strategy, the structure of the test directory, and guidelines for contributing to the test suite.

## 1. Test Strategy Overview

The testing strategy for Flowlet is designed to cover various aspects of the platform, from individual components to end-to-end user flows and system performance under load. It encompasses unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), and performance testing, each serving a distinct purpose in validating the system's correctness and robustness.

This multi-layered approach ensures that changes to the codebase are thoroughly validated, regressions are caught early, and the system consistently meets its functional and non-functional requirements. The strategy emphasizes automated testing to facilitate continuous integration and delivery practices.

## 2. Test Directory Structure

The `tests` directory is structured to logically separate different types of tests, making it easy to navigate and manage the test codebase. The current structure is as follows:

```

```

Each sub-directory within `tests` corresponds to a specific testing category, as detailed in the following sections.

## 3. Test Categories

### 3.1. Unit Tests

**Location**: `tests/unit/`

Unit tests are the foundational layer of the Flowlet test suite. They focus on verifying the correctness of individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation. The primary goal of unit tests is to ensure that each small, testable piece of code performs as expected, independent of other components or external dependencies.

These tests are typically fast to execute and provide immediate feedback on the impact of code changes. Mocking external dependencies (such as databases, external APIs, or other microservices) is a common practice in unit testing to maintain isolation and ensure that only the logic of the component under test is being validated.

Examples of unit tests include:

-   **Wallet Service**: Validating wallet creation, balance updates (deposits, withdrawals, transfers), transaction history logging, and state transitions (e.g., active, suspended, closed).
-   **Payment Processing**: Ensuring correct validation of payment requests, routing logic for different payment methods, transaction status updates, and fee calculations.
-   **Card Issuance and Management**: Testing card issuance (virtual/physical), activation/deactivation, spending limit enforcement, and card control functionalities (e.g., freezing, merchant categories).
-   **KYC/AML Compliance**: Verifying identity verification workflows, risk assessment logic, document processing and validation, and triggers for ongoing monitoring.
-   **Ledger and Accounting**: Confirming adherence to double-entry accounting principles, accurate journal entry generation, real-time balance calculations, and reconciliation logic.
-   **API Gateway**: Testing authentication and authorization logic, rate limiting, request routing, and response caching mechanisms.
-   **AI-Enhanced Capabilities (Fraud Detection)**: Validating fraud detection model inference, alert generation, and anomaly detection capabilities.

### 3.2. Integration Tests

**Location**: `tests/integration/`

Integration tests are designed to verify the interactions and communication between different services and components of the Flowlet platform. Unlike unit tests, integration tests assess whether multiple modules or services work together correctly as a group, ensuring data consistency and correct flow across the system boundaries.

These tests are crucial for identifying issues that arise from the interaction between components, such as incorrect API contracts, data serialization/deserialization problems, or misconfigurations. They often involve real dependencies or mock services that closely mimic the behavior of actual external systems.

Key integration scenarios covered include:

-   **Payment Flow**: Testing the complete flow from a user initiating a payment, through the wallet balance update, ledger entry creation, and interaction with payment processors. This includes handling both successful and failed payment scenarios.
-   **Card Transaction Flow**: Verifying the process from a card transaction (e.g., swipe or online purchase) to the corresponding wallet balance update and ledger entry creation. This also includes testing the enforcement of card controls during transactions.
-   **Onboarding Flow**: Validating the end-to-end user onboarding process, including user signup, wallet creation, and the KYC/AML verification process. Different outcomes of the verification process are also tested.
-   **API Gateway to Service Communication**: Ensuring that requests from the API Gateway are successfully routed to their respective microservices and that error handling for service unavailability is robust.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Location**: `tests/e2e/`

End-to-End (E2E) tests simulate complete user journeys through the Flowlet platform, from the frontend user interface (UI) to the backend services. These tests are designed to ensure that the entire system functions as expected from a user's perspective, covering all integrated components and their interactions.

E2E tests provide the highest level of confidence in the system's overall functionality and user experience. They mimic real-world scenarios and validate critical business flows, often involving UI automation tools to interact with the web application as a user would.

Key E2E scenarios include:

-   **Full User Registration and Login**: Testing the complete registration process with both valid and invalid data, followed by successful and unsuccessful login attempts with correct and incorrect credentials.
-   **Wallet Operations via UI**: Verifying the ability to perform deposits and withdrawals through the user interface and accurately view transaction history.
-   **Card Management via UI**: Testing the process of requesting a new card and the functionality to freeze or unfreeze a card through the UI.
-   **Payment Initiation via UI**: Simulating the process of making a payment to another user or merchant via the UI and verifying the correct display of payment status.

### 3.4. Performance Tests

**Location**: `tests/performance/`

Performance tests are critical for assessing the Flowlet platform's scalability, responsiveness, and stability under various load conditions. These tests help identify performance bottlenecks, evaluate system behavior under stress, and ensure that the platform can handle expected user loads and transaction volumes.

Performance testing typically involves simulating a large number of concurrent users and operations to measure metrics such as response times, throughput, and resource utilization. The `locustfile.py` is used for defining user behavior and load profiles.

Key performance testing scenarios include:

-   **Concurrent User Simulations**: Simulating a large number of concurrent users performing a variety of operations, such as logging in, conducting wallet transactions, and making API calls, to assess system behavior under typical and peak loads.
-   **Load Spikes**: Testing the system's ability to handle sudden and significant increases in load, evaluating its resilience and recovery mechanisms.
-   **Long Duration Tests**: Monitoring system stability and resource utilization over extended periods to detect memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or other issues that may manifest over time.

## 4. Test Implementation Guidelines

To maintain a high standard of quality and consistency within the Flowlet test suite, the following implementation guidelines should be adhered to:

-   **Frameworks**: Utilize Python's `unittest` or `pytest` framework for writing unit and integration tests. These frameworks provide robust capabilities for test organization, execution, and reporting.
-   **Isolation**: For unit tests, always mock external dependencies (e.g., external APIs, databases) to ensure that tests are truly isolated and only the logic of the component under test is being validated. This prevents external factors from influencing test results.
-   **Data**: Use realistic and representative test data for integration and E2E tests. This helps in uncovering issues that might only appear with specific data patterns or volumes.
-   **Test Principles**: Ensure that tests are:
    -   **Atomic**: Each test should focus on a single, specific aspect of functionality.
    -   **Independent**: Tests should not depend on the order of execution or the state left by previous tests.
    -   **Repeatable**: Running the same test multiple times should yield the same result, assuming the code under test remains unchanged.
    -   **Self-Validating**: Tests should automatically determine if they passed or failed without manual intervention.
    -   **Timely**: Tests should run quickly to provide rapid feedback to developers.
-   **Naming Conventions**: Maintain clear and concise test names that accurately describe the functionality being tested. This improves readability and makes it easier to understand the purpose of each test at a glance.

By following these guidelines, the Flowlet test suite will remain robust, maintainable, and an effective tool for ensuring the quality of the platform.
