# Flowlet Backend - Refined Documentation

## Overview

The Flowlet Backend is a robust, modular platform designed to support financial technology operations. It is built around a microservices-like structure within a Python framework, emphasizing security, compliance, and advanced analytics.

## 1. Core Directory Structure

The backend is organized into a main application (`app/`) and a comprehensive source directory (`src/`) that houses the core business logic and specialized services.

| Directory | Primary Function | Key Components |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **app/** | Main application entry point and basic structure. | `api/` (Basic Auth), `models/` (Core User/Account models). |
| **src/** | Core business logic and specialized services. | `ai/`, `analytics/`, `compliance/`, `integrations/`, `security/`, `nocode/`. |
| **instance/** | Runtime data and configuration. | SQLite database files (`flowlet_*.db`). |
| **logs/** | Application logging. | `flowlet.log`. |
| **tests/** | Comprehensive testing suite. | `api/`, `functional/`, `integration/`, `performance/`, `security/`, `unit/`. |

## 2. Specialized Services in `src/`

The `src/` directory is the heart of the Flowlet backend, containing highly specialized modules.

| Module | Primary Function | Key Sub-Components/Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ai/** | Advanced AI/ML services for financial intelligence. | `fraud_detection.py`, `risk_assessment.py`, `transaction_intelligence.py`, `support_chatbot.py`. |
| **analytics/** | Data processing and reporting. | `dashboard_service.py`, `reporting_engine.py`, `real_time_analytics.py`. |
| **compliance/** | Regulatory adherence and legal services. | `aml_engine.py`, `kyc_service.py`, `regulatory_framework.py`, `compliance_engine.py`. |
| **integrations/** | External system connectivity. | `banking/` (Plaid, Open Banking), `payments/` (Stripe), `currency/`. |
| **nocode/** | Business logic configuration tools. | `rule_engine.py`, `workflow_builder.py`, `config_engine.py`. |
| **security/** | Authentication, authorization, and threat prevention. | `authentication.py`, `encryption_service.py`, `rate_limiter.py`, `threat_prevention.py`. |
| **database/** | Database setup and connection. | `app.db`, `flowlet.db`. |
| **routes/** | API endpoint definitions. | `auth.py`, `payment.py`, `wallet.py`, `analytics.py`, `kyc_aml.py`. |

## 3. Testing Suite Overview

The `tests/` directory is structured to cover all aspects of the application, from low-level units to end-to-end performance.

| Test Category | Location | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit** | `tests/unit/` | Verify individual functions and classes in isolation. |
| **API** | `tests/api/` | Validate API endpoint responses and data contracts. |
| **Functional** | `tests/functional/` | Test end-to-end user flows and core business logic. |
| **Integration** | `tests/integration/` | Verify interactions between services (e.g., banking integrations). |
| **Performance** | `tests/performance/` | Measure latency and throughput of critical paths (e.g., gateway). |
| **Security** | `tests/security/` | Validate security controls (e.g., rate limiting, authentication). |

## 4. Key Configuration and Entry Points

| File/Component | Description | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `main.py` | Main application entry point. | Initializes the application and runs the development server. |
| `wsgi.py` | WSGI entry point. | Used for production deployment with WSGI servers (e.g., Gunicorn). |
| `config.py` | Base configuration file. | Contains environment-agnostic settings. |
| `src/config/settings.py` | Detailed application settings. | Defines environment-specific variables and feature flags. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies. | Lists all required libraries for the project. |
| `Procfile` | Heroku/Cloud deployment configuration. | Defines processes for the application (e.g., web, worker). |

## 5. Development and Operations

The backend uses a standard Python development setup.

| Area | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python 3.x |
| **Framework** | Flask (implied by file structure) or similar lightweight framework. |
| **Database** | SQLite for development/testing, production-ready RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL) for deployment. |
| **Testing** | `pytest` (implied by `conftest.py` in test structure). |
| **Test Execution** | `./run_tests.sh` script for comprehensive test execution. |
