### Overview of Cybersecurity Regulations in the Financial Sector (Source: UpGuard)

The financial sector is heavily regulated due to the sensitive nature of the data it handles. The proliferation of cyberattacks has led to the establishment of several mandatory cybersecurity regulations. Compliance with these regulations is crucial for financial institutions to maintain trust, safeguard sensitive data, and avoid legal or financial consequences.

Key takeaways from the UpGuard article:

*   **Financial Cybersecurity Compliance**: Adherence to laws and security regulations setting the minimum standard for data security within the financial industry. These are established by governments or authoritative security bodies.
*   **Problem with Regulatory Compliance**: The sheer volume of different security standards and significant overlaps can be problematic. The focus should be on mandatory regulations, with optional standards considered for additional security benefits.

#### Top 9 Cybersecurity Regulations Mentioned:

1.  **EU-GDPR (European General Data Protection Regulation)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Designed to protect EU citizens from personal data compromise.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to all businesses processing data linked to EU citizens, regardless of physical location.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes.
    *   **Penalties**: Maximum fine of €20 million or 4% of annual turnover (whichever is larger).

2.  **UK-GDPR (United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation)**:
    *   **Purpose**: UK's version of EU-GDPR, retaining most EU-GDPR laws with slight modifications for domestic law.
    *   **Scope**: Focuses solely on the protection of personal data of UK residents.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes.
    *   **Penalties**: Maximum fine of £17.5 million or 4% of annual global turnover (whichever is greater).

(The article continues to list other regulations like HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, etc. I will extract information about these as I scroll down.)



3.  **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)**:
    *   **Purpose**: A US federal law that mandates certain practices in financial record keeping and reporting for public companies. It aims to protect investors from fraudulent accounting activities.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to all US public company boards, management, and public accounting firms.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes.
    *   **Penalties**: Fines and imprisonment for non-compliance.

4.  **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
    *   **Purpose**: A set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to all entities involved in payment card processing.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes (for entities handling card data).
    *   **Penalties**: Fines, increased transaction fees, and potential loss of ability to process card payments.

5.  **BSA (Bank Secrecy Act)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Requires financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. It mandates record-keeping and reporting requirements for certain financial transactions.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to financial institutions operating in the US.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes.
    *   **Penalties**: Significant civil and criminal penalties.

6.  **GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Requires financial institutions to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to financial institutions in the US.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes.
    *   **Penalties**: Fines and imprisonment.

7.  **PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive 2)**:
    *   **Purpose**: A European regulation for electronic payment services. It aims to increase competition in the payments industry, enhance consumer protection, and promote innovation.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to payment service providers in the EU.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes.
    *   **Penalties**: Varies by country, but can include significant fines.

8.  **FFIEC (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Provides guidance and examination procedures for financial institutions on various topics, including cybersecurity.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to financial institutions examined by FFIEC member agencies.
    *   **Mandatory**: Guidance, but compliance is expected.
    *   **Penalties**: Regulatory actions and fines for non-compliance with underlying regulations.

9.  **DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)**:
    *   **Purpose**: A new EU regulation aiming to strengthen the IT security of financial entities. It focuses on operational resilience against cyber threats.
    *   **Scope**: Applies to financial entities and critical third-party ICT service providers in the EU.
    *   **Mandatory**: Yes.
    *   **Penalties**: Significant fines.

### Key Areas for Refactoring based on Financial Industry Standards:

Based on these regulations, the following areas in the Flowlet backend require significant refactoring:

*   **Data Security and Encryption**: Strengthen encryption for data at rest and in transit. Implement robust key management. Ensure sensitive data (e.g., card numbers, bank account details) is tokenized and securely stored, with proper access controls for detokenization.
*   **Authentication and Access Control**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, especially administrators. Enhance role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure least privilege. Review API key management for stronger security, including granular permissions, IP whitelisting, and regular key rotation.
*   **Audit Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive, immutable audit logs for all critical actions, including data access, modifications, and system events. Ensure logs are securely stored and regularly monitored for suspicious activities. This is crucial for compliance with regulations like SOX and GLBA.
*   **Data Integrity and Transactional Consistency**: Ensure all financial transactions adhere to ACID properties. Implement explicit database transactions with proper rollback mechanisms. Use `Decimal` for all monetary calculations to avoid floating-point errors. The current implementation of ledger entries needs to be rigorously reviewed to ensure strict double-entry accounting principles are followed.
*   **KYC/AML Compliance**: Enhance the KYC/AML module to support real-time identity verification, robust document validation, and continuous watchlist screening against sanctions lists (OFAC, UN, EU). Implement a clear process for handling suspicious activity reports (SARs) as required by BSA. The risk scoring mechanism should be more sophisticated and configurable.
*   **Error Handling and Resilience**: Implement standardized, granular error codes and messages. Introduce robust rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks. Consider implementing circuit breakers and retry mechanisms for external API calls to enhance system resilience.
*   **Incident Response and Business Continuity**: While not directly code-related, the backend should support features that aid in incident response, such as detailed logging and monitoring. The architecture should be designed for high availability and disaster recovery.
*   **Secure Coding Practices**: Conduct a thorough code review to identify and remediate common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, insecure direct object references). Implement secure coding guidelines and use static/dynamic analysis tools.
*   **Configuration Management**: Externalize all sensitive configurations (database credentials, API keys, third-party service credentials) using environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

This research provides a solid foundation for the refactoring efforts in the subsequent phases.
