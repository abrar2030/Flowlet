# Authentication API Documentation

The Authentication API provides endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, and security features like two-factor authentication and password recovery. It is designed with financial-grade security and auditability.

## Base URL

`/api/v1/auth`

## Financial Industry Standards and Considerations

- **Secure Password Management**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are hashed using strong, industry-standard algorithms (e.g., Argon2 or bcrypt) with unique salts per user. Password policies enforce complexity requirements (length, character types) to enhance security.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for session management. Access tokens are short-lived, while refresh tokens allow for seamless re-authentication without requiring users to re-enter credentials frequently. All tokens are transmitted over HTTPS.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Support for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is provided, allowing users to add an extra layer of security to their accounts. 2FA setup, verification, and recovery mechanisms are implemented securely.
- **Rate Limiting**: To protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts, rate limiting is applied to sensitive endpoints like login, registration, and password reset requests.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails are maintained for all authentication-related events, including login attempts (successful and failed), password changes, 2FA setup, profile updates, and token generation. Logs include timestamps, IP addresses, user agents, and relevant event details.
- **Input Validation**: All user-provided input is rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL injection.
- **Account Lockout**: After multiple failed login attempts, accounts are temporarily locked to mitigate brute-force attacks. The duration of the lockout increases with repeated failures.
- **Secure Communication**: All communication with the Authentication API is encrypted using TLS/SSL (HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
- **Data Privacy**: User data is handled in accordance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Sensitive personal information is protected, and users have control over their data.
