# Flowlet Scripting Guide

This guide provides detailed explanations of the various utility scripts used in the Flowlet project, located in the `Flowlet/scripts/` directory. These scripts automate common tasks related to backup, deployment, monitoring, and setup.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/backup/`: Contains scripts for backing up data.
- `scripts/deployment/`: Contains scripts for deploying the Flowlet application.
- `scripts/monitoring/`: Contains scripts for monitoring the Flowlet infrastructure.
- `scripts/setup/`: Contains scripts for setting up development environments or prerequisites.

## Backup Scripts

### `backup/backup.sh`

This script is responsible for performing database backups. It typically includes commands to dump data from PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis instances.

**Usage**:

```bash
./scripts/backup/backup.sh
```

**Functionality**:

- Connects to various database instances (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis).
- Executes database-specific backup commands (e.g., `pg_dump`, `mongodump`, `redis-cli BGSAVE`).
- Stores backup files in a designated location (e.g., a local directory, cloud storage).

**Prerequisites**:

- `kubectl` configured to access the Kubernetes cluster.
- Database client tools installed in the environment where the script is run (or within the database pods).

## Deployment Scripts

### `deployment/deploy.sh`

This script automates the deployment of the Flowlet application to a Kubernetes cluster. It typically orchestrates the application of Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.

**Usage**:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh
```

**Functionality**:

- Applies Kubernetes manifests from `kubernetes/manifests/`.
- Installs or upgrades Helm charts from `kubernetes/helm/`.
- Ensures all necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Ingresses) are created or updated.

**Prerequisites**:

- `kubectl` configured to access the Kubernetes cluster.
- `helm` installed and configured.

## Monitoring Scripts

### `monitoring/monitor.sh`

This script provides basic monitoring functionalities, such as checking the health of various services and components.

**Usage**:

```bash
./scripts/monitoring/monitor.sh
```

**Functionality**:

- Checks the status of Kubernetes pods and deployments.
- Verifies service health endpoints.
- Can be extended to integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus or Grafana.

**Prerequisites**:

- `kubectl` configured to access the Kubernetes cluster.

### `monitoring/setup-monitoring.sh`

This script sets up monitoring tools and configurations within the Kubernetes cluster.

**Usage**:

```bash
./scripts/monitoring/setup-monitoring.sh
```

**Functionality**:

- Deploys Prometheus and Grafana to the cluster.
- Configures Prometheus to scrape metrics from Flowlet services.
- Imports Grafana dashboards for visualization.

**Prerequisites**:

- `kubectl` configured to access the Kubernetes cluster.
- Helm (if monitoring tools are deployed via Helm charts).

## Setup Scripts

### `setup/setup-dev.sh`

This script helps set up a local development environment for Flowlet.

**Usage**:

```bash
./scripts/setup/setup-dev.sh
```

**Functionality**:

- Installs necessary dependencies (e.g., Python packages, Node.js modules).
- Sets up local databases or mocks.
- Configures environment variables for local development.

**Prerequisites**:

- Python, Node.js, and their respective package managers (`pip`, `npm`/`pnpm`).

### `setup/setup_k8s_prereqs.sh`

This script installs Kubernetes prerequisites on a machine, such as `kubectl`, `minikube`, or `kind`.

**Usage**:

```bash
./scripts/setup/setup_k8s_prereqs.sh
```

**Functionality**:

- Installs `kubectl`.
- Installs a local Kubernetes cluster tool (e.g., Minikube or Kind).
- Configures `kubeconfig` for cluster access.

**Prerequisites**:

- Appropriate operating system and package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu, `brew` for macOS).

## General Scripting Best Practices

- **Idempotency**: Scripts should be idempotent, meaning running them multiple times should produce the same result as running them once.
- **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling to gracefully manage failures.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to provide clear output and aid in debugging.
- **Modularity**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions or scripts.
- **Documentation**: Keep script comments and external documentation up-to-date.
