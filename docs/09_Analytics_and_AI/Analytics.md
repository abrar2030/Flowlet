# Analytics API Documentation

The Analytics API provides endpoints for retrieving various financial analytics and insights for users, including dashboard summaries, spending patterns, income analysis, and balance history. These analytics are crucial for users to understand their financial behavior and for the platform to monitor financial trends.

## Base URL

## Financial Industry Standards and Considerations

- **Data Aggregation and Privacy**: While aggregating data for analytics, strict measures are in place to ensure user data privacy. Aggregated data is anonymized where appropriate, and individual user data is only accessible with proper authentication and authorization.
- **Real-time vs. Historical Data**: The API provides both real-time snapshots (e.g., current balance) and historical trends (e.g., spending over time). For historical data, robust data warehousing and processing ensure accuracy and availability.
- **Categorization and Insights**: Spending and income are categorized to provide meaningful insights. While some categorization is automated, mechanisms for user-defined categories or adjustments are considered for enhanced accuracy.
- **Performance and Scalability**: Analytics endpoints are optimized for performance to handle large volumes of transactional data and provide timely responses, crucial for a responsive user experience in a financial application.
- **Auditability of Data**: Although analytics are derived, the underlying transactional data remains auditable, ensuring that all figures can be traced back to their source for compliance and reconciliation purposes.
