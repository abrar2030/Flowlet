## Integration with Flowlet Platform

### Routing Integration
- Added `/workflows` route to main application
- Integrated with existing authentication and layout systems
- Added workflow navigation item to sidebar

### Design System Consistency
- Uses existing Flowlet UI components and design tokens
- Maintains consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Follows established patterns for forms, buttons, and layouts

### Security Considerations
- Workflow execution permissions
- Node configuration validation
- Secure data handling in workflow processing

## Usage Instructions

### Creating a New Workflow
1. Navigate to the Workflows section in the sidebar
2. Click "Create Workflow" button
3. Drag nodes from the palette to the canvas
4. Connect nodes by dragging from output to input handles
5. Configure each node using the properties panel
6. Save and test the workflow

### Using Templates
1. Go to the Templates tab in the workflow section
2. Browse available templates by category
3. Preview template details and features
4. Click "Use Template" to create a new workflow from template
5. Customize the workflow as needed

### Monitoring Workflows
1. View workflow performance in the Analytics tab
2. Monitor execution history and success rates
3. Analyze errors and optimize workflow performance
4. Track cost savings and efficiency metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Connectors**: More sophisticated connection types
- **Workflow Versioning**: Version control for workflow changes
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multi-user workflow editing
