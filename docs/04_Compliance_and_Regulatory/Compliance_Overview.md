# Compliance API Documentation

The Compliance API provides advanced functionalities for regulatory reporting, watchlist screening, and transaction pattern analysis, crucial for a Fintech startup operating in a highly regulated financial industry. It is designed to assist in meeting Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations.

## Financial Industry Standards and Considerations

- **Regulatory Reporting (SAR/CTR)**: The API facilitates the generation of Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTR), which are mandatory filings for financial institutions to report suspicious or large cash transactions to regulatory bodies (e.g., FinCEN in the US).
- **Watchlist Screening**: Integrates with various watchlist sources (OFAC, UN, EU sanctions, PEP lists) to screen users and transactions against known sanctioned entities, politically exposed persons, and other high-risk individuals or organizations. This is a critical component of AML/CTF compliance.
- **Transaction Monitoring and Pattern Analysis**: Implements sophisticated algorithms to analyze transaction patterns for anomalies, such as structuring (breaking large transactions into smaller ones to avoid reporting thresholds), round amount transactions, rapid succession transactions, and unusual timing. This proactive monitoring helps identify potential money laundering or fraud activities.
- **Audit Trails**: All compliance-related actions, including screening results and report generations, are meticulously logged to provide a comprehensive audit trail, essential for regulatory examinations and internal compliance reviews.
- **Data Security and Privacy**: Handles sensitive user and transaction data with the highest level of security, ensuring data encryption in transit and at rest, and strict access controls. Data used for analysis is anonymized or pseudonymized where possible to protect privacy while maintaining analytical utility.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Designed to handle large volumes of transactional data and perform real-time or near real-time screening and analysis, critical for high-throughput financial operations.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Reporting thresholds and risk parameters are configurable, allowing the system to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements and risk appetites.
