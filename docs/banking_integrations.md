# Banking Integrations API Documentation

The Banking Integrations API provides a robust and secure interface for connecting Flowlet with various external banking systems. This API is critical for enabling functionalities such as fetching account information, retrieving transaction history, and initiating payments across different financial institutions. Designed with financial industry standards in mind, it emphasizes secure authentication, data integrity, and reliable transaction processing.

## Base URL

`/api/v1/banking`

## Financial Industry Standards and Considerations

- **Secure Authentication**: All interactions with external banking systems are secured using industry-standard authentication mechanisms. The API provides endpoints to manage and authenticate these integrations securely.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive financial data, including account numbers and transaction details, are encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Transaction Integrity**: The API ensures the atomicity and reliability of financial transactions. Payment initiations include fallback mechanisms to ensure successful processing even if a preferred integration fails.
- **Comprehensive Logging and Audit Trails**: All API calls and interactions with banking integrations are meticulously logged, providing a complete audit trail for compliance, reconciliation, and troubleshooting purposes.
- **Error Handling and Resilience**: Robust error handling and specific error codes are implemented to provide clear feedback on integration issues, authentication failures, or invalid account details. The system is designed to be resilient to external system failures.
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports integration with multiple banking partners and is designed to scale to handle a high volume of account and transaction data.
- **Compliance**: The API design considers various financial regulations and best practices, particularly concerning data access, transaction reporting, and customer data protection.
