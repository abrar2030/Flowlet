## Security and Compliance Considerations for Scripts

Given the critical nature of these operational scripts in a financial context, the following security and compliance considerations are paramount:

*   **Least Privilege:** Scripts should always run with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using `sudo` or root privileges unless absolutely essential, and ensure that any credentials used are managed securely (e.g., via environment variables, Kubernetes Secrets, or a secrets management system).
*   **Input Validation:** Any script that accepts user input or parameters should rigorously validate and sanitize that input to prevent command injection or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Scripts must include robust error handling to gracefully manage failures and provide clear, actionable error messages. Comprehensive logging of script execution, including successes, failures, and key actions, is essential for auditing and troubleshooting. These logs should be immutable and securely stored.
*   **Version Control:** All scripts must be under strict version control (as they are in this repository) to track changes, facilitate rollbacks, and ensure auditability. Changes to scripts should follow the same rigorous review and approval processes as application code.
*   **Auditing:** The execution of these scripts, especially in production environments, should be auditable. This includes who ran the script, when it was run, and what actions it performed. Integration with centralized logging and monitoring systems is key here.
*   **Secrets Management:** Hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., database passwords, API keys) within scripts is strictly prohibited. Instead, use secure secrets management solutions.
*   **Idempotency:** Where applicable, scripts should be idempotent, meaning that running them multiple times produces the same result as running them once. This is particularly important for deployment and setup scripts to prevent unintended side effects.
*   **Regular Review:** Scripts should be regularly reviewed by security and operations teams to identify potential vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with evolving standards, and optimize for efficiency and security.
