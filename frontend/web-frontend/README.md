## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm
- Modern browser with Web Crypto API support

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run security audit
npm run security-audit

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.flowlet.com
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://api.flowlet.com
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_SECURITY_MODE=strict
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Security Configuration
Located in `src/config/security.js`:
- Content Security Policy settings
- Encryption parameters
- Authentication rules
- Rate limiting configuration

### Compliance Configuration
Located in `src/config/compliance.js`:
- GDPR settings
- PCI DSS requirements
- Audit logging configuration
- Data retention policies

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Development
1. **Never store sensitive data** in localStorage or sessionStorage without encryption
2. **Always validate and sanitize** user inputs
3. **Use HTTPS** in all environments
4. **Implement proper error handling** to avoid information leakage
5. **Regular security audits** and dependency updates

### Deployment
1. **Enable all security headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
2. **Use secure cookie settings** (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
3. **Implement proper logging** and monitoring
4. **Regular penetration testing** and vulnerability assessments
5. **Incident response procedures** and escalation paths

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Security Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Session timeout events
- Security violations and threats
- Performance impact of security measures

### Compliance Metrics
