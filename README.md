## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Flowlet is engineered on a **cloud-agnostic microservices architecture**, designed for maximum scalability, resilience, and security. This approach facilitates consistent deployment across diverse environments, from public clouds to on-premises infrastructure. The system adheres to a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, organizing services around distinct business capabilities for independent evolution and targeted scaling.

The infrastructure leverages **containerization (Docker)** for application packaging and **orchestration (Kubernetes)** for managing and scaling containers. **Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)** ensures reproducible deployments and simplified disaster recovery. Communication is primarily **event-driven via Apache Kafka**, enhancing resilience and decoupling services, supplemented by REST APIs and gRPC for synchronous interactions through the unified API Gateway. A **polyglot persistence strategy** is employed, utilizing optimal database technologies for specific service requirements.

### System Components and Implementation Layers

The Flowlet platform is logically divided into six key layers, each with a defined role and corresponding implementation within the codebase:

1.  **API Layer**: The primary entry point for all external interactions. Implemented by the API Gateway (`backend/src/gateway/optimized_gateway.py`), which handles authentication, rate limiting, and intelligent routing. Documentation is extensive in `docs/03_API_Reference`.
2.  **Core Services Layer**: Encapsulates the fundamental financial services. These are distinct, independently deployable microservices found in `backend/src/routes`, such as Wallet Management (`wallet.py`), Payment Processing (`payment.py`), and KYC/AML (`kyc_aml.py`).
3.  **Integration Layer**: Responsible for securely connecting Flowlet with external financial systems. Integrations for banking partners (e.g., Plaid, FDX) are in `backend/src/integrations/banking`, and payment processor integrations (e.g., Stripe) are in `backend/src/integrations/payments`.
4.  **Data Layer**: Manages system state and analytics using a polyglot persistence model. Kubernetes configurations for various databases (`postgresql.yaml`, `mongodb.yaml`, `redis.yaml`) are in `infrastructure/kubernetes/databases`. The SQLAlchemy ORM models are defined in `backend/src/models`.
5.  **Support Services Layer**: Provides cross-cutting functionalities. This includes authentication services (`backend/src/routes/auth.py`), notification capabilities (`backend/src/utils/notifications.py`), and the comprehensive AI services in `backend/src/ai` and `backend/src/ml`.
6.  **Infrastructure Layer**: The foundational layer for deployment, monitoring, and security. Kubernetes orchestration is managed via configurations in `infrastructure/kubernetes` and Helm charts in `infrastructure/helm`. Monitoring systems (Prometheus/Grafana) are configured in `infrastructure/kubernetes/monitoring`, and CI/CD pipelines are defined in `.github/workflows`.
