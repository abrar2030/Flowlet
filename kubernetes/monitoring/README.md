## Monitoring, Logging, and Observability

This directory contains configurations for monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing within the Kubernetes cluster. For financial applications, it is paramount that all monitoring and logging data is securely stored and accessible only to authorized personnel.

**Security Considerations for Observability Data:**

*   **Access Control:** Implement strict RBAC policies for Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, Kibana/OpenSearch Dashboards, and Jaeger. Only authorized roles should have access to sensitive metrics, logs, and traces.
*   **Data Encryption:** Ensure that data at rest (e.g., Elasticsearch indices, Prometheus storage) and data in transit (e.g., between Fluent Bit and Elasticsearch, Prometheus and Grafana) is encrypted. This typically involves TLS/SSL for in-transit encryption and disk encryption for at-rest data.
*   **Data Retention:** Define and enforce data retention policies for logs and metrics to comply with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS). Regularly purge or archive old data.
*   **Audit Trails:** Ensure that access to monitoring and logging systems is audited, and audit logs are themselves securely stored and monitored for suspicious activity.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Use Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network access to monitoring and logging components. For example, only Fluent Bit pods should be able to send logs to Elasticsearch, and only Grafana should be able to query Prometheus.
*   **Secrets Management:** Sensitive information like API keys or database credentials used by monitoring agents should be managed securely using external secrets solutions (as outlined in the `secrets/README.md`).

**Components Implemented:**

*   **Prometheus:** For collecting and storing metrics.
*   **Grafana:** For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
*   **Fluent Bit:** For lightweight log aggregation from pods.
*   **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch:** For centralized log storage and indexing.
*   **Kibana/OpenSearch Dashboards:** For searching, analyzing, and visualizing logs.
*   **Kube-state-metrics:** For exposing Kubernetes object metrics to Prometheus.
*   **Alertmanager:** For handling alerts generated by Prometheus.
*   **Jaeger:** For distributed tracing to monitor request flows across microservices.

By combining these tools with robust security practices, you can achieve comprehensive observability while maintaining the high security and compliance standards required for financial applications.
