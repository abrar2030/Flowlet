## Security Scanning

For continuous security and compliance, it is crucial to implement automated security scanning for both container images and Kubernetes configurations.

**Image Scanning:**

*   **Trivy:** A comprehensive and easy-to-use vulnerability scanner for container images, filesystems, and Git repositories. It can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to scan images before deployment.
*   **Clair:** An open-source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities in application containers.

**Kubernetes Configuration Scanning:**

*   **Kube-bench:** Checks whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the checks documented in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
*   **Kube-hunter:** Hunts for security weaknesses in Kubernetes clusters from an attacker's perspective.
*   **Open Policy Agent (OPA) / Gatekeeper:** Policy engine that can enforce custom policies on Kubernetes resources, ensuring configurations adhere to security best practices and compliance requirements.

**Integration:**

These tools should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that no vulnerable images or misconfigured Kubernetes resources are deployed to production environments. Regular scans of the running cluster are also recommended.
