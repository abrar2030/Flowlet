## Secrets Management

For enhanced security and compliance, especially in financial environments, it is highly recommended to use an external secrets management solution instead of storing sensitive information directly in Kubernetes Secrets. Kubernetes Secrets, by default, are only base64 encoded, not encrypted at rest.

**Recommended External Secrets Solutions:**

*   **HashiCorp Vault:** A widely adopted solution for managing secrets, providing a secure and auditable way to store and access sensitive data.
*   **Cloud Provider Secret Managers:**
    *   **AWS Secrets Manager:** For applications deployed on AWS.
    *   **Azure Key Vault:** For applications deployed on Azure.
    *   **Google Secret Manager:** For applications deployed on Google Cloud.

These solutions offer advanced features such as:

*   Centralized secrets management.
*   Dynamic secret generation.
*   Lease and revocation capabilities.
*   Audit trails.
*   Integration with Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems.

**Implementation:**

To integrate an external secrets manager, you would typically use a Kubernetes operator (e.g., External Secrets Operator) that synchronizes secrets from the external system into Kubernetes Secrets, or directly consume secrets from your application using the external secret manager's SDK.

**Note:** The `flowlet-secrets.yaml` file is provided as an example for basic Kubernetes Secret usage. For production financial environments, migrate these secrets to an external solution.
