## Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy

This directory outlines the strategy for backing up Kubernetes cluster configurations and application data, and defines the disaster recovery plan for the Flowlet application. For financial applications, a robust DR strategy is critical to ensure business continuity and data integrity.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Regular Backups:** Automated and frequent backups of Kubernetes cluster state (etcd), application configurations, and persistent volumes.
*   **Offsite Storage:** Store backups in a geographically separate and secure location to protect against regional outages.
*   **Encryption:** All backups must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   **Testing:** Regularly test the backup and restore process to ensure its reliability and to validate RTO/RPO objectives.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation of the DR plan.

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO):**

*   **RTO:** (Example: 4 hours) The maximum tolerable duration of time that a computer system, network, or application can be down after a disaster or disruption.
*   **RPO:** (Example: 15 minutes) The maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident.

**Backup Components:**

*   **Kubernetes Cluster State:** Back up `etcd` data to restore the cluster's control plane.
*   **Application Configurations:** Version control all Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and configuration files in a Git repository (GitOps).
*   **Persistent Volumes (PVs):** Use Velero (configured in `velero.yaml`) to backup and restore application data stored in Persistent Volumes. Velero integrates with cloud provider snapshot capabilities.

**Disaster Recovery Steps (High-Level):**

1.  **Detect Disaster:** Identify the scope and impact of the disaster.
2.  **Activate DR Plan:** Initiate the disaster recovery process.
3.  **Provision New Infrastructure:** Provision a new Kubernetes cluster in a different region or availability zone.
4.  **Restore Cluster State:** Restore the Kubernetes control plane from `etcd` backups.
5.  **Deploy Core Services:** Deploy essential services like monitoring, logging, and secrets management.
6.  **Restore Application Configurations:** Deploy application manifests and Helm charts from the Git repository.
7.  **Restore Persistent Volumes:** Use Velero to restore application data to the new Persistent Volumes.
8.  **Validate and Test:** Thoroughly test the restored application functionality and data integrity.
9.  **DNS Failover:** Update DNS records to point to the new cluster's ingress.

**Tools Used:**

*   **Velero:** For Kubernetes cluster resource and persistent volume backups.
*   **Git:** For version controlling all Kubernetes configurations (GitOps).

This strategy ensures that the Flowlet application can quickly recover from a disaster with minimal data loss, meeting the stringent requirements of financial standards.
